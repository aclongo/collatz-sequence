# collatz-sequence
This is my solution for the assignment at the end of chapter 3 in "Automate the Boring Stuff with Python" - a simple program for executing the collatz sequence.

As of now, it meets the requirements of the assignment, including adding input validation for noninteger input (strings).

Improvements to be made later: 
  1. Checking user input for negative integers or '0'.
  2. Allowing the user to input again after a sequence has been completed.
