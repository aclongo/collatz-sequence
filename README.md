# collatz-sequence
This is my solution for the assignment at the end of chapter 3 in "Automate the Boring Stuff with Python" - a simple program for executing the collatz sequence.

Improvements to be made once I learn more: 
  1. Checking user input for negative integers or '0', right now it only invalidates strings.
  2. Allowing the user to input again after a sequence has been completed
